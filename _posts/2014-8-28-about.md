title: About me
---

My name is Nathan. I'm just another Aussie finding his way in London accompanied in life by my beautiful wife, Rachel.

I was born in Melbourne, Australia. I moved to Brisbane in primary school and lived there until only a few years ago. Moving to London has been a life-changing experience and I'm happy Rachel was more adventurous than I, encouraged and eventually convincing me to take the steps to move.

I worked at Fujitsu through my undergraduate degrees. When I graduated I joined Grabba International as a design engineer doing electronics and software design. I progressed within Grabba to doing product management, and even dabbled in business management and business development doing an MBA part time and helping to establish their European subsidiary in the UK.

Through trial and error I've come to realise that, though I still enjoy coding and electronics design myself, product management is what I enjoy doing the most. I love building products that people need, that people want and that people love to use.

I've worked on desktop and web applications, mobilility hardware devices and enterprise mobility solutions, identification and payment technologies, wireless and RFID comms, and mobile apps.

I've worked in or with these companies over the years:
