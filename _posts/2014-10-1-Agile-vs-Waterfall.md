title: Agile vs Waterfall
---

Having done both electronics engineering and software engineering in my undergraduate degrees, I was exposed to both waterfall and agile methodologies from the outset. I've practiced both to varying degrees of rigidity in my work. I mainly used waterfall in electronics product development while I mainly used agile in software development. This has ranged from no methodology at all (which isn't really waterfall _or_ agile per se) to formal methodologies such as PMI or scrum. 

As a product manager I'm often asked for my thoughts on 'Agile vs Waterfall'. It has been a pretty common interview question, since it helps gauge fit within the development team or organisation whilst offering the interviewee a chance to describe their experience with whatever practices that organisation uses. The topic also seems to have as many opinions as the number of people you ask.

Waterfall and agile methodologies both get a bad rap, undeservedly in my opinion. Agile methodologies are described as becoming _anything but_ agile, where teams have the prescribed meetings, develop in sprints, produce the prescribed outputs but are still too rigid in their development plan and unable to change in the face of new information. Waterfall is described as being completely unsuited to software development and anyone still using it for software projects are laughed at.

My opinion is somewhat more ambivalent. I believe either waterfall and agile methodologies can be used successfully if used in the right situation. There are much more important factors which would determine success of a product/project than which methodology the team is using or even whether they're using waterfall or agile. Here are the main points as to where I stand:

Simple to chaotic projects:

 * Waterfall is best suited to a project that is unlikely to change dramatically; when the project is simple or even complicated on a Stacey Matrix.
 * Agile is better suited, and indeed was developed for, projects where there are unknowns around technology or requirements; when the project is complex or chaotic on a Stacey Matrix.
 * Agile can work in simpler projects, but you will have overheads of reviewing each iteration when things are rarely changing. It may also feel to the team like they're just splitting up a predefined 'waterfall project' into iterations.
 * Waterfall does not work too well in complex and chaotic projects. You're likely going to be over budget and over time. You'll also likely deliver something that the user/customer doesn't want, doesn't like, or that doesn't solve their problem. NB. It may meet the user requirements specifications set out, but that doesn't mean everyone will be happy.

Agile vs 'being agile':

 * Following formal agile methodologies are not the cause of projects becoming less agile.
 * Having prescribed agile meetings each iteration (e.g. planning sessions, grooming sessions, retrospectives) can help you stay agile, but having them won't guarantee you _will_ be.
 * Following agile _principles_ are more important than the agile methodology if you want to continue being agile.
 * Becoming less agile is caused by things like the team resisting change to the product in spite of information suggesting the current plan isn't right, or not identifiying/testing assumptions during development.
