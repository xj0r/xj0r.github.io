title: Communication with Senior Management
---

Effective communication with senior managers at product inception and throughout development are key to product success and are an important responsibility for Product Managers. Without it even potentially great products may become derailed.

You may be a Product Manager working in a large (perhaps bureaucratic) organisation where there are set processes for project reporting and communication. Processed may not appear in line with common agile development practices and will likely go against lean thinking for product development. Alternatively you may be working in small startups where formal communication about products does not appear necessary. Senior management are within earshot of the team and involved throughout inception and development anyway.

The amount of reporting required will depend on the type and stage of the product and the organisation. At whatever end of the spectrum, I hope you find the following tips and considerations useful.

## Why

It goes without saying that having senior management involved in your product is a good idea for many reasons. As some of these may be overlooked, I have listed a few specific examples, but obviously this is by no means an exhaustive list.


   * to make the most of their experience and expertise
   * getting ideas you may not have considered
   * so they may become, or continue to be, comfortable that you know what you are doing
   * for budgeting, financing and resourcing that particular development phase of the product
   * to align expectations and give comfort around product delivery timeframes, risks and success criteria
   * evaluating and getting feedback for your product across the entire company or portfolio of products under their responsibility.

## When

If possible, involve stakeholders right from project inception and throughout development. 
 
In some cases senior management are not asking to be involved. Perhaps their day to day interaction with you and the project team is enough to make them comfortable, they are deferring to and entrusting you to do your job as the Product Manger, or they may not actually be invested in your product. Whatever the case, you should try to involve them at a minimum at these key points in the product development process.

At product inception, adapted from Roger Martin’s HBR article "Help Leaders Be Less Useless at Strategy”, involve management:  

   * when framing the product strategy
   * when you have a shortlist of strategic options
   * when you have decided on a strategic course (being ready to with your justification). 

This does not necessarily mean inclusion in inception workshops, just so long as the communication is done.

Throughout product development and delivery, involve management:

   * when the product development is off track, or just a quick update that it is on track
   * when key risks, especially those they were concerned about, have been addressed
   * when KPIs have been met, or if it turns out they likely are not going to be met
   * when things change or new developments arise which affect your product strategy
   * when you have successes worth shouting about.

This will give them comfort and align their expectations with how the product is actually performing. Knowing about successes gives them the opportunity to justify having backed your product and allow them to share in its success with you and your team.

## What

At the product inception stage you may be using product vision and road-mapping tools, filling in product or business model canvases, or answering questions from an inception deck. These among others are really great tools for focusing on the right things, ensuring you are considering the key areas for your product strategy and for facilitating inception workshops and discussions with your team.

Many of the outputs from these tools are important details for communicating to senior management. Remember, they are typically busy people so don’t waste their time with every little detail. Instead, you may just want to have details and justifications to hand when they ask.

The key areas most senior managements want or need to know about are:

   * high level product vision and how it fits with the business goals
   * what is it you are building now and why (e.g. what problem does it solve)
   * how it will succeed (partners, competitors, cost structure, value proposition, etc)
   * how long it will take and how much it will cost to do what you are proposing
   * what are the key risks and when/how will they be addressed (ideally riskier addressed sooner)

Throughout the product development process, there will be all kinds of reports, charts and other outputs from software tools you may be using. Remember again these will not necessarily be a useful means of communication to senior management. What _is_ useful will depend on organisational processes, requirements for standardised reports to make comparisons across their portfolio easier, or simply your senior manager’s preferences.

Certainly use standard outputs if they are the best way to present the information and facilitate effective communication. However, if there are better ways to communicate then use those instead!

For example not everyone understands a burndown chart, but communicating whether you are on track can be done in many ways. You can still be transparent and make reports and outputs available if senior management are interested in seeing them. You can also, over time, educate people on burndown charts to save time translating it to something else. The point is you should first and foremost make sure you are communicating effectively for your situation and for your audience.

## How

How to communicate with senior management again will depend on your situation. As the Product Manager, you are responsible for the product’s success which includes getting buy-in from senior management and their continued support for your product. As such, communication with them is _important_.

It would be ideal to involve senior management in product strategy discussions and getting regular participation _throughout_ the development process. However in certain situations this will just not be feasible. Try discussing with senior management which communication methods would work best for them at each stage.

If setting aside a meeting to present a slide-deck will work best, then do that. Put effort into the presentation, come prepared to answer questions and concerns, and ask for feedback. It is usually useful to send the presentation deck around beforehand so they have a chance to consider what else they need to know. The meeting itself should then involve more feedback and discussion.

If sending an email with the key details or simply updating a wiki page they have access to works better for your senior management, then by all means.

If standardised company reports are required for them to create buy-in for your product at the board level, so be it. If you feel that the standardised reports are creating extra work, are not adding value to the business, or are not aligned with how agile software development should be done, then you should tackle that as a _separate_ issue. Deciding simply not to do them for your product because you think it is a waste of your time is not going to help your product succeed.
