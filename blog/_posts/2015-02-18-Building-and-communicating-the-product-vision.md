title: Building and communicating the product vision
---

When starting a new product, it is important to understand the vision for the product and communicating that vision clearly across the organisation. The vision focuses the team and wider organisation so they know why they're working on it, why it is important and to whom. It gives the team their purpose and will filter through to the product itself.

This may seem obvious enough for new products (though perhaps not always simple to achieve, so I can recommend Roman Pichler's [blog post](http://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-writing-compelling-product-vision) as a good starting point for those interested).

However, as a Product Manager you're not always starting on new products from scratch, you may be taking on existing projects the business already had under way. Even for existing products and projects you take on, it is important to make sure there is a vision and that it is clearly communicated.

I recently started working on an existing project in my new role. I inherited the project from someone who had moved on from the business before I joined, so the handover was limited to an overview discussion or two from my new managers and fellow product team members, a stack of documents to read through, and introductions to key people in the organisation to talk to further about it.

To me, the project was quite clear. Some of the overview documents outlined a clear vision and high level goals. The business case, user research, user needs and competitive landscape all aligned with the vision for the project. People I spoke to across the organisation were aligned with what needed to be done. So this initially led me to believe I was jumping onto a moving train and all was well.

But the project wasn't moving forward, the train had stopped. In my discussions with my managers trying to understand why, it turned out what was missing wasn't necessarily a compelling vision for the project or misaligned goals with that vision, but it was simply a problem with the communication of that vision across the organisation. Back to the drawing board!

So remember, whether you're starting out on a new product or you're taking on existing projects, ensure there is a clear vision and high level goals that align with that vision. Then, ensure that the vision is communicated clearly across the organisation. You may need to go back to the drawing board yourself, but aligning the team and organisation on what you're building and why is extremely important and the effort is worthwhile.
