Just another Aussie finding his way in London.

Currently a Product Manager at Digital Science. I love building products that people need, that people want and that people love to use. Previously worked with mobile devices, identification and payment technologies, wireless and RFID comms, and mobile apps.

I enjoy cycling, running, travelling, programming, and tech gadgets.

Also photography; check out my tumblr blog, which I update occasionally.
